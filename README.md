## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo>
cd water-demand-research-ohrid

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### 2. Generate Synthetic Data
```python
from src.data_collectors.ohrid_synthetic_generator import OhridWaterDemandGenerator

# Initialize generator with Ohrid-specific parameters
generator = OhridWaterDemandGenerator()

# Generate 3 years of hourly data
data = generator.generate_synthetic_data(
    start_date="2021-01-01",
    end_date="2023-12-31"
)
```

### 3. Train Models
```python
from src.models.ohrid_predictor import OhridWaterDemandPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = OhridWaterDemandPredictor()

# Prepare data
X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test, features = predictor.prepare_data_for_modeling(data)

# Train all model types
predictor.fit_arima_models(y_train)
predictor.fit_machine_learning_models(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)
predictor.fit_deep_learning_models(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)
predictor.create_hybrid_ensemble(X_train, y_train)
```

### 4. Evaluate and Compare
```python
# Comprehensive evaluation
results = predictor.evaluate_models(X_test, y_test)
comparison = predictor.compare_models()

# Visualizations
predictor.plot_feature_importance()
predictor.plot_predictions(y_test)
```
